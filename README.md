# Learning Scala

This is my playground to learn Scala. The [beginner](./beginner) project refers to the [Rock the JVM - Scala For Beginner](https://www.udemy.com/course/rock-the-jvm-scala-for-beginners) course on Udemy.

I created from the courses some [Scala Cheat Sheets](./docs/ScalaCheatSheet.md).
